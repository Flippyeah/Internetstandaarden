          <h3>The Legend of Komodo Dragons</h3>
          <p>
            Long ago, the people of Komodo Island believed that the fearsome
            Komodo dragons were mystical creatures with special powers.
            According to local folklore, these dragons possessed the ability to
            heal and protect the island. One story tells of a dragon that saved
            a lost child by guiding them back to their village. Though the
            legend may be embellished, it adds a touch of enchantment to the
            island's fascination with these remarkable reptiles.

          <h3>Hidden Cove</h3>
          <p>
            >Explorers seeking adventure on Komodo Island have occasionally
            stumbled upon a hidden cove known as "Dragon's Haven." Surrounded by
            towering cliffs and accessible only by boat, this secluded paradise
            offers pristine beaches and crystal-clear waters. It's said that the
            cove got its name from the belief that Komodo dragons once sought
            refuge there during storms, adding an element of mystery to this
            picturesque spot.
