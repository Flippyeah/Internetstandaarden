            <h3>The Legend of Komodo Dragons</h3>
            <p>
              Long ago, the people of Komodo Island believed that the fearsome
              Komodo dragons were mystical creatures with special powers.
              According to local folklore, these dragons possessed the ability
              to heal and protect the island. One story tells of a dragon that
              saved a lost child by guiding them back to their village. Though
              the legend may be embellished, it adds a touch of enchantment to
              the island's fascination with these remarkable reptiles.

            <p>
