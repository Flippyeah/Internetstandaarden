        <h3>Iguazu falls</h3>
        <p>
          The legend of the creation: According to Guarani folklore, the
          indigenous people of the region, Iguazu Falls was created when a
          jealous deity sliced the river in two, forming the waterfalls. The
          legend tells of a beautiful woman who was sacrificed to the river, and
          in response, the deity created the falls to commemorate her. This myth
          adds a touch of mystique to the already awe-inspiring natural beauty
          of the falls.

          <h3>The Devils Throat</h3>
          <p>
            The Devil's Throat: One of the most famous sections of Iguazu Falls
            is the "Garganta del Diablo" or "Devil's Throat." It is a U-shaped
            chasm where the majority of the water flows. The name comes from the
            thunderous sound of the water crashing down and the mist that rises,
            creating an eerie atmosphere. The view from the viewing platform
            overlooking the Devil's Throat is absolutely mesmerizing.

          <h3>The Island and the Hotspot</h3>
          <p>
            Island Within a Waterfall: One of the most unique features of Iguazu
            Falls is the presence of San Martín Island, located at the heart of
            the falls on the Argentine side. This island is essentially a lush,
            forested oasis surrounded by the roaring cascades. Visitors can take
            boat trips to the island to experience the falls up close and even
            hike on designated trails amidst the pristine natural surroundings.
            Biodiversity Hotspot: The surrounding rainforest of Iguazu National
            Park is not only home to the falls but also a biodiversity hotspot.
            It is home to a vast array of wildlife, including jaguars, toucans,
            and coatis. The park's rich ecosystem and unique flora and fauna
            make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
