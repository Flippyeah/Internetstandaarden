            <h3>Iguazu falls</h3>
            <p>The legend of the creation: According to Guarani folklore, the indigenous people of the region, Iguazu Falls was created when a jealous deity sliced the river in two, forming the waterfalls. The legend tells of a beautiful woman who was sacrificed to the river, and in response, the deity created the falls to commemorate her. This myth adds a touch of mystique to the already awe-inspiring natural beauty of the falls.</p>

                    <h3>The Devils Throat</h3>
                    <p>The Devil's Throat: One of the most famous sections of Iguazu Falls is the "Garganta del Diablo" or "Devil's Throat." It is a U-shaped chasm where the majority of the water flows. The name comes from the thunderous sound of the water crashing down and the mist that rises, creating an eerie atmosphere. The view from the viewing platform overlooking the Devil's Throat is absolutely mesmerizing.

                    <h3>The Island and the Hotspot</h3>
                    <p>Island Within a Waterfall: One of the most unique features of Iguazu Falls is the presence of San Mart√≠n Island, located at the heart of the falls on the Argentine side. This island is essentially a lush, forested oasis surrounded by the roaring cascades. Visitors can take boat trips to the island to experience the falls up close and even hike on designated trails amidst the pristine natural surroundings.
                    Biodiversity Hotspot: The surrounding rainforest of Iguazu National Park is not only home to the falls but also a biodiversity hotspot. It is home to a vast array of wildlife, including jaguars, toucans, and coatis. The park's rich ecosystem and unique flora and fauna make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
